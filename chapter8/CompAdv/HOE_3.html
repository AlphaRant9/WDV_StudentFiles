        <th>Thor: Ragnarok</th>
        <td>
            Imprisoned on the other side of the universe, the mighty Thor finds himself in a deadly gladiatorial contest
            that pits him against the Hulk, his former ally and fellow Avenger. Thor's quest for survival leads him in a
            race against time to prevent the all-powerful Hela from destroying his home world and the Asgardian
            civilization.

        <th>Spider-Man: No Way Home</th>
        <td>
            With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighborhood web-slinger is unmasked and no longer
            able to separate his normal life as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero. When Peter asks
            for help from Doctor Strange, the stakes become even more dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly
            means to be Spider-Man.

        <th>Cars</th>
        <td>
            In a world where the towns are peopled with cars, and even the bugs are mini motors, a young ambitious
            racing car called Lightning McQueen is a star. On his way to an important event he has to stop in the little
            town of Radiator Springs after he accidentally damages the road and is forced to repair it. He finds living
            in a community oddly endearing, making true friends and beginning to realise there's more in life than
            winning.
