                <i>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</i> Is the final film in the Prequel trilogy of the <i>Star Wars</i>
                franchise. It has been three years since the Clone Wars began. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan
                McGregor) and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian
                McDiarmid) from General Grievous, the commander of the droid armies, but Grievous escapes. Suspicions
                are raised within the Jedi Council concerning Chancellor Palpatine, with whom Anakin has formed a bond.
                Asked to spy on the chancellor, and full of bitterness toward the Jedi Council, Anakin embraces the
                Dark Side.
