            <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Spaghetti</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil and fresh garlic</li>
                <li>Dried oregano, salt, and pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>


            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cook Spaghetti:</strong> Fill a large Dutch oven or pot with cold water 3/4 full and bring to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and
                    spaghetti.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure pasta does not stick together:</strong> Separate pasta with tongs a few times during the first
                    2 minutes of cooking to ensure it does not stick.</li>
                <li>Keep cooking uncovered for 5 more minutes or until al dente, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li><strong>Drain pasta:</strong> Test the spaghetti for doneness towards the end by grabbing one strand onto a plate
                    with tongs. Do not overcook until too soft. The key to tasty pasta is cooked pasta with a bite.
                    Drain in a colander.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook garlic:</strong> Return the pot to medium heat and add the olive oil, 4 garlic cloves, and oregano.
                    Cook for 20 seconds, stirring constantly. Garlic cooks fast and can easily burn, so donâ€™t walk away.
                    Turn off the heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Add remaining ingredients:</strong> Drained pasta, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 tsp salt, ground black pepper,
                    and 1 more fresh garlic clove. Stir gently until warmed through. That 1 clove of fresh garlic at the
                    end is a must!
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sprinkle with Parmesan...</strong> and serve this spaghetti with tomato sauce immediately!</li>
            </ol>
